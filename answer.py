    This is to review interactive loops and if statements
    You need to write for loop to make a list output of the prime number from 2 to the number.
    The range of numbers should not include the number as input.
    Example1:
            Input: number = 10
            Output:[2,3,5,7]
    Example2:
            Input: number = 100
            Output:[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
    Example3:
            Input: number = 7
            Output:[2,3,5]

    This is to review interactive loops and error statements
    At first,  you need to write try statement to check String input,
    If input is not an integer number, output will be String "Error".
    Finally you need to write a while loop to calculate the sum of num, num - 1, num -2,.....,1.
    Example1:
            Input: "3"
            Output: 6
            Explanation: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
    Example2:
            Input: "Hello"
            Output: "Error"
            Explanation: Checked as a String in try statement, return "Error" with except statement.
    Example3:
            Input: "-1"
            Output: 0
            Explanation: It is an integer but nothing to do in while loop, so return defualt value as 0.
