    This is to review interactive loops and if statements
    You need to make a list output of the prime number from 2 to the number as a integer larger than 2.
    Example1:
            Input: number = 10
            Output:[2,3,5,7]
    Example2:
            Input: number = 100
            Output:[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]

def while_loop():
    
    """
    This is to review interactive loops and error statements
    At first,  you need to use try statement to make a integer input,
    Then you need to check the input is number or not.
    If input is not number, output will be String "Error".
    Finally you need to make a while loop to calculate the sum of num, num - 1, num -2,.....,1.
    Example1:
            Input: 3
            Output: 6
            Explanation: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
    Example2:
            Input: Hello
            Output: Error
            Explanation: Checked as a String in try statement, return "Error" with except statement.
    Example3:
            Input: -1
            Output: 0
            Explanation: It is an integer but nothing to do in while loop, so return defualt value as 0.
